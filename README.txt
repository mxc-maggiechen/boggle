The class named "Discount_Boggle" is the full project coded in accordance to the instructions provided with documentation.
    "Discount_Boggle" has all of the functions required by the instructions, an option to reset the board with a different assortment of randomized letters, as well as a functioning GUI

The class named "Hard_Discount_Boggle" contains all of the functions required by the instructions, but the program follows actual Boggle rules (i.e. you can zig-zag accross the board to create words, the only requirement to create a word is that each successive letter must be in contact with its previous letter).
    "Hard_Discount_Boggle" does not have a GUI, the option to reset the board with a different assortment of randomized letters, or proper documentation.
    This class was created because I originally misinterpreted the project instructions and thought that we had to recreate Boggle in accordance to its rules.
